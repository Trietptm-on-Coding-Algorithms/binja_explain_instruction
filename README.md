# binja_explain_instruction
This plugin adds a popup window to Binary Ninja that explains in simple English what an x86 instruction does.

### Read the Limitations section in detail before using this plugin, or you may find it confuses you more than it helps you.

## Assumed Knowledge Level
The descriptions are intended to be simple enough for a novice to understand. However, there is some previous knowledge assumed, notably that the reader understands the concepts of a register, an instruction, the stack, etc.

## Limitations
There are over 600 instructions in the current x86 instruction set. Rather than attempt to parse them all, the explanations here are generated by reading the corresponding Binary Ninja Low-Level Intermediate Language, which operates at a higher level. Unfortunately, the LLIL does not support corresponding operations for the entire x86 instruction set, and this project does not even (currently) have documentation for the entire set of LLIL instructions. This project will aid beginners in understanding what common instructions do, and will hopefully help with some of the "What on earth does that instruction do?" moments, but will certainly not be able to replace consulting the documentation.

Since this project is based on the Low-Level intermediate language, it may provide useful results on architectures other than x86. However, this is completely untested, and unlikely to meet any reasonable standard of completeness. Pull requests to add support for additional architectures are very welcome!

Some instructions do not have equivalents in the LLIL, and on occasion, multiple assembly instructions may be folded into one LLIL instruction. Notably, the corresponding LLIL instruction for a conditional jump folds the conditional expression in as well. While not technically true, it is much closer to the truth to assume a 1-to-1 correspondence between the LLIL and the the assembly than it is to assume the same correspondence between the MLIL and the assembly.

The MLIL corresponding to a given instruction may not, in fact, correspond to that instruction alone. While it is particularly helpful for understanding what parameters are passed to a function, in other cases it may fold previous instructions into the operation described. Use it for a helpful cross reference, but don't assume a 1-to-1 equivalency between the MLIL and the assembly.

When available, the window provides a link to the documentation for each instruction. This link uses simple parameter substitution into the URL, and may not actually be correct. It's intended to save you a few clicks, but you may still need to google the instruction.

## Contributing

This project is designed to make it simple to add support for new LLIL instructions.
